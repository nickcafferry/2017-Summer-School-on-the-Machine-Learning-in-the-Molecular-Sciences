This is a quick-and-dirty utility for converting a FASTA format alignment into
the PSICOV input alignment format.

To compile:

cc -O fasta2aln.c -o fasta2aln


Usage:

fasta2aln myalignment.fasta > output.aln


IMPORTANT NOTE:

Make sure the first sequence in the FASTA file is your desired target sequence, as
the program will remove any columns with gaps in the first sequence.
