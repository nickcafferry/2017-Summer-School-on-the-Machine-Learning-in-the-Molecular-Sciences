# Welcome to Machine Learning in the Molecular Sciences
---

[![UosEmd.md.jpg](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/21/UosEmd.md.jpg)](https://imgchr.com/i/UosEmd)

### Aims

The NYU-ECNU Center for Computational Chemistry at [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) (a.k.a, NYU Shanghai) announced a summer school dedicated to machine learning and its applications in the molecular sciences to be held June, 2017 at the NYU Shanghai Pudong Campus. Using a combination of technical lectures and hands-on exercises, the school aimed to instruct attendees in both the fundamentals of modern machine learning techniques and to demonstrate how these approaches can be applied to solve complex computational problems in chemistry, biology, and materials science. In order to promote the idea of free to code, this project is built to help you understand some basic machine learning models mentioned below.

### Panel-Topics

Fundamental topics to be covered include basic machine learning models such as *kernel methods* and *neural networks optimization schemes*, *parameter learning* and *delta learning paradigms*, *clustering*, and *decision trees*.  Application areas will feature machine learning models for representing and predicting properties of individual molecules and condensed phases, learning algorithms for bypassing explicit quantum chemical and statistical mechanical calculations, and techniques applicable to biomolecular structure prediction, bioinformatics, protein-ligand binding, materials and molecular design and various others.

   AppendTo[$Path,FileNameJoin[{"Path","to","library"}]]; (* Parent directory containing QMMLPack directory *)
   
   ```
   
- **Thursday-June-15**

  For __Practical Session: Machine Learning of Free Energy Surfaces__, please run these commands on Linux system (In order to compile the code, a C++ compiler and the mkl library will be needed): 
  
_1._ Unpack the tar file:                 

                                        tar -xzvf Neural_network_practical_software.tar.gz

_2._ Change Command-Line-Interface to the directory created by unpacking and compile the source code. At the beginning, edit 'Makefile' and change the C and C++ compliers to the corresponding ones you have available on your sytem, e.g., 'gcc' and 'g++' or 'icc' if necessary. The complie the code by typing 
                        
                                                             make

 _3._ Create a training data set from the full dataset. One of two commands is avaiable for use:
                       
                                         head -n ala-dip-data_all.txt > ala-dip-data.txt
                                         tail -nl ala-dip-data_all.txt > ala-dip-data.txt

     Here n is the number of training points you wish to extract from the full dataset.
     
  _4_. Edit the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th lines in the file "INPUT.txt" if you want to change the calculation type, number of conjugate gradient steps, checkpointing frequency of weights, and number of conjugate gradient line-minmization steps.

### External-Links

One of the exciting aspects of Machine-Learning (ML) techniques is their possible to democratize molecular and materials modelling with 
relatively economical computational calculations and low level entry for common folks. (Pople's Gassian software makes quantum chemistry 
calculations really approachable).

#### Open education: 

* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai) is a course that is “making neural nets uncool again” by making them accessible to a wider community of researchers. 
One of the advantages of this course is that users start to build working machine-learning models almost immediately. However, it is not for absolute
beginners, requiring a working knowledge of computer programming and high-school-level mathematics.

* [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) ofers an excellent introduction to coding for data-driven science and covers many practical analysis tools 
relevant to chemical datasets. This course features interactive environments for developing and testing code and is suitable for non-coders because it
teaches Python at the same time as machine learning.

* Academic MOOCs are useful courses for those wishing to get more involved with the theory and principles of artifcial intelligence and machine learning,
as well as the practice. The [Stanford MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is popular, with excellent alternatives available from 
sources such as [edx](https://www.edx.org) (see, for example, ‘Learning from data (introductory machine learning)’) and [udemy](https://www.udemy.com)
(search for ‘Machine learning A–Z’). The underlying mathematics is the topic of a course from Imperial College London [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning).

* Many machine-learning professionals run informative blogs and podcasts that deal with specifc aspects of machine-learning practice. These are useful 
resources for general interest as well as for broadening and deepening knowledge. There are too many to provide an exhaustive list here, but we recommend
[machinelearningmastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com) and [lineardigression](http://lineardigressions.com) as a starting point.
